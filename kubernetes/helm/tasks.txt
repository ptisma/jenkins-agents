1. setup minikube with 1 node

2. setup jenkins controller on minikube

3. setup jenkins with static node and cloud using helm config 






So far it works but the agents do not have access to the docker, add dind as sidecar to every agent pod



everything again but on minikube with multiple nodes and custom non static volumes?
